- âœ… Category browsing (APT sections with LMDB indexes)
- âœ… LMDB caching system with section indexes
- âœ… Qt6 UI with KDE Plasma 6 styling
- âœ… Context actions system
- âœ… Package details view with full metadata
- âœ… Virtual scrolling for large lists
- âœ… Background operations with worker threads
- âœ… Privilege escalation with pkexec
- âœ… Security update indicators
- âœ… Double-click package details navigation
- âœ… Plugin architecture (base implementation)
- âœ… Panel controller architecture

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Flatpak backend plugin

### Planned (Design Phase)
- ðŸ“‹ Plugin architecture (requires refactor)
- ðŸ“‹ Flatpak backend support
- ðŸ“‹ AppImage backend support
- ðŸ“‹ Multi-backend unified search
- ðŸ“‹ Repository management UI

## Modular Package System Architecture

### Unified Package Management Interface
- Single UI supporting multiple package backends
- Consistent user experience across all package types
- Backend-agnostic search and discovery
- Unified package information display

### Package System Priority
1. **APT (Primary)**: Traditional Debian/Ubuntu packages
2. **Flatpak (Secondary)**: Sandboxed applications
3. **AppImage (Third)**: Portable applications

## Core Package Functionality

### Unified Search & Discovery
- Cross-backend search by name, description, or keywords
- Filter by package type (APT, Flatpak, AppImage)
- Filter by status (installed, available, upgradable)
- Category-based browsing (development, games, multimedia, etc.)
- Source indication for each package result

### Unified Package Information
- Display package details (version, size, dependencies, description)
- Show installation status and available versions
- View package changelog and maintainer information
- Backend-specific metadata (APT: dependencies, Flatpak: permissions, AppImage: portable info)
- Source repository/store information

### Unified Package Operations
- Install packages with backend-appropriate dependency resolution
- Remove packages (APT: with dependency options, Flatpak: clean removal, AppImage: file deletion)
- Update individual packages or system-wide updates
- Backend-specific operations (APT: purge, Flatpak: permissions management)
- Batch operations across multiple backends

### System Management
- Update package cache/repository lists for all backends
- Upgrade system packages across all package types
- Clean package cache and orphaned packages
- Handle broken dependencies (APT-specific)
- Manage Flatpak repositories and runtimes
- AppImage integration and organization

### User Interface Features
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Undo/rollback capability for recent operations

### Advanced Features
- Package pinning/holding (APT)
- Repository management (APT PPAs, Flatpak remotes)
- Package history and transaction logs across all backends
- Batch operations (install/remove multiple packages)
- Export/import package lists with backend information
- AppImage integration and auto-update management

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- âœ… Asynchronous operations to prevent UI freezing
- âœ… Efficient package list caching with LMDB
- âœ… Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- âœ… Section-based indexing for fast category browsing
- Incremental search results

### Security
- âœ… Privilege escalation handling (pkexec)
- Package signature verification
- âœ… Safe handling of system operations
- âœ… Background operations prevent UI manipulation during install/remove

### Integration
- System notification support
- Desktop file associations
- Command-line interface compatibility
