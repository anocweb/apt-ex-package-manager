# Planning Documentation

This directory contains implementation plans and design documents for planned features.

## Current Plans

### Privilege Escalation System
**Status**: Design Complete, Implementation Pending  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

Implement PolicyKit + D-Bus privilege helper system to maintain elevated privileges across multiple package operations, reducing authentication prompts and improving UX.

**Documents**:
- [Full Implementation Plan](PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Complete implementation guide with phases, code examples, and testing strategy
- [Quick Reference](PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_QUICK_REF.md) - Quick reference for developers

**Key Features**:
- Credential caching for 5 minutes (PolicyKit default)
- Per-backend privilege helpers (APT, Flatpak, etc.)
- Graceful fallback to pkexec when helper unavailable
- Main application remains unprivileged
- D-Bus communication for security

**Integration**:
- Integrates with existing plugin architecture
- Each plugin optionally provides privilege helper
- No changes required to views or UI
- Backward compatible with pkexec fallback

## Future Plans

Additional implementation plans will be added here as features are designed.

### Potential Topics
- Flatpak backend implementation
- AppImage backend implementation
- ODRS ratings integration
- Repository management UI
- Transaction history system
- Automatic update scheduling
