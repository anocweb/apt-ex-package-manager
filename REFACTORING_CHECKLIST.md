## üîÑ Testing Required

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test application startup
- [ ] Test home panel navigation and search
- [ ] Test installed packages panel loading
- [ ] Test updates panel loading and display
- [ ] Test category browsing
- [ ] Test settings panel
- [ ] Test about panel
- [ ] Test category list panel
- [ ] Test package installation (if implemented)
- [ ] Test package removal (if implemented)
- [ ] Test cache refresh
- [ ] Test context actions on each panel
- [ ] Test sidebar navigation
- [ ] Test log viewer
- [ ] Test status bar messages
- [ ] Test backend selector (home panel)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify all panels load correctly
- [ ] Verify signals are properly connected
- [ ] Verify workers complete successfully
- [ ] Verify cache operations work
- [ ] Verify settings persistence

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test error handling in workers
- [ ] Test error display in panels
- [ ] Test graceful degradation when backends unavailable

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate
1. [ ] Run the application and verify basic functionality
2. [ ] Fix any import errors or path issues
3. [ ] Test each panel thoroughly
4. [ ] Update any broken functionality

### Short Term
1. [ ] Add unit tests for panel controllers
2. [ ] Add unit tests for workers
3. [ ] Update any documentation referencing old file locations
4. [ ] Consider adding type hints to panel methods

### Long Term
1. [ ] Consider adding view models if state management becomes complex
2. [ ] Consider creating widget factory for backend-specific widgets
3. [ ] Consider extracting backend selector as reusable component
4. [ ] Monitor performance and optimize as needed

## üêõ Known Issues / TODOs

- [ ] Category panel needs full implementation (currently stub)
- [ ] Cache validation logic needs implementation (marked as TODO)
- [ ] Some panel methods may need additional error handling
- [ ] Consider adding loading indicators to panels

## üìä Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- `main_view.py`: ~1000 lines
- UI files: Flat structure (20+ files in one directory)
- Workers: Inline in main_view.py
- Panels: All logic in main_view.py

### After Refactoring
- `main_view.py`: ~400 lines (60% reduction)
- UI files: Organized in 3 subdirectories
- Workers: 3 dedicated modules
- Panels: 8 dedicated controllers + 1 base class
- Services: +1 (StatusService)

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: ‚úÖ Excellent
- **Maintainability**: ‚úÖ Significantly improved
- **Testability**: ‚úÖ Much easier to test
- **Scalability**: ‚úÖ Easy to add new panels
- **Readability**: ‚úÖ Clear structure

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] Main view reduced to coordinator role
- [x] Each panel has dedicated controller
- [x] Workers extracted to separate modules
- [x] UI files organized by type
- [x] Base panel class provides common functionality
- [ ] Application runs without errors
- [ ] All features work as before
- [ ] Code is easier to understand and maintain

## üìö Reference Documents

- `docs/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed summary of changes
- `docs/developer/PANEL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Guide for creating new panels
- `src/views/main_view_old.py` - Original implementation (backup)

## üîß Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Restore `main_view_old.py` as `main_view.py`
2. Move UI files back to flat structure
3. Remove new directories (panels, workers)
4. Document issues encountered
5. Plan incremental migration approach
